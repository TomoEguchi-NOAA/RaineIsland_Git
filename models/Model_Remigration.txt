  # Modeling remigration intervals with just tag and return data

  # data
  # nt: number of tags deployed per year; a vector
  # mt: the number of recaptured turtles; a matrix of r x c where rows (r)
  #     are years since tagging and columns (c) are different years. c should
  #     equal to the length of nt
  # phi: assumed survival rate of females - assume it is a constant.
  
  # assumes no tag loss
  
  # priors
  # first assume the remigration intervals to be Poisson
  # this may be time dependent so mu becomes a vector
  mu ~ dunif(2, 20)
  p ~ dbeta(1, 1)   # this is "capture probability"

  # or use gamma?
  #alpha_r ~ dunif(0.1, 100) 
  #beta_r ~ dunif(0.1, 100)

      # likelihood needs to be defined here... 
      # something like... remigration interval * some data...
