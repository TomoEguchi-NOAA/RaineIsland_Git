  # simple binomial model for repeated Lincoln-Petersen
  # abundance estimation - from Gazey and Staley 1986
  
  # data
  # n: Total number of painted turtles
  # mt: the number of painted turtles seen at time t
  # Ct: the total number of turtles seen at time t
  
  # we estimate p = n/N, which is the binomial p, then
  # compute N from n/phat
